	how you find out the name of the docked ship

the captain owns a pair of binoculars and he can use them to see what the name of the ship is. He says he will tell you it's name if you can solve his puzzle/riddle first.

To solve the puzzle/riddle you will need to figure out the name of one of the cannons

ideas:
	the position of the cannon compared to the other cannons (there are names written on the cannons)
	a riddle where the name of the cannon is the solution
